ðŸ”¬ **Predictive Analysis of Lung Cancer using Machine Learning**

This project aims to predict risk of lung cancer in patients using machine learning techniques.

------
ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

Source: Kaggle (Lung Cancer Prediction)

Features include: age, gender, symptoms like smoking, air pollution, fatigue, and more.

Target: Whether the patient is at high risk of lung cancer.

-------
ðŸ§¹ **Preprocessing**

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Removed highly correlated features

Checked skewness (none exceeded Â±1)

Applied StandardScaler for normalization

Encoded categorical variables with LabelEncoder

--------
ðŸ¤– **Models Used**

Logistic Regression

Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)


**All models achieved:**

Accuracy: 1.0

Precision/Recall/Specificity: 1.0


(SVM used 10-fold cross-validation; others used hold-out with test size = 0.2)
